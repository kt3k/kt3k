My name is Yoshiya Hinosawa. I've been a web engineer in 🇯🇵 for about 10 years. I specialize in frontend development. Currently I work on Deno 🌧🦕.

I use mainly JavaScript and TypeScript for my job, and sometimes I use Rust, Golang, Python, Java, etc depending on the situations. I've published ~100 packages to npm ( https://www.npmjs.com/~kt3k ).

I've been learning Rust 🦀, Go, and OCaml 🐪 recently.
