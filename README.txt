My name is Yoshiya Hinosawa. I'm a web developer in 🇯🇵 for about 10 years. I'm currently a partner of @seqsense, a robot 🤖 startup in :jp:.

I'm a Deno 🦕 enthusiast in my spare time.

I use mainly JavaScript and TypeScript for my job, and sometimes I use Golang, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc depending on the situations. I've published ~100 packages to npm ( https://www.npmjs.com/~kt3k ).

I've been learning Rust 🦀, Go, and OCaml 🐪 recently.
