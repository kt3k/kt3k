I'm @kt3k, Yoshiya Hinosawa. I'm a web developer in 🇯🇵 with about 10 year experience in web development. I'm currently a partner of @seqsense, an autonomous robot startup 🤖 based in :jp:.

I'm a Deno 🦕 enthusiast in my spare time.

I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript for software development. I've published ~100 packages to npm ( https://www.npmjs.com/~kt3k ).

I've been learning Rust 🦀, Go, and OCaml 🐪 recently.
