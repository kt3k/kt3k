My name is Yoshiya Hinosawa. I've been a web engineer in 🇯🇵 for about 15 years. I specialize in frontend development. Currently I work for Deno 🦕🌧.

I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript for my job and hobby. Sometimes I use Rust 🦀, Golang, Python 🐍, Java, etc.

These days I've been learning Rust, Lean (https://github.com/leanprover/lean4), etc.
