:wave: Hello

I'm @kt3k, Yoshiya Hinosawa. I'm a web developer in :jp: with about 10 year experience in web development. I'm currently a partner of @seqsense, an autonomous robot startup :robot: based in :jp:.

I'm a Deno :sauropod: enthusiast in my spare time.

I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript for software development. I've published [~100 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~kt3k) to npm.

I've been learning Rust :crab:, Go, and OCaml :camel: recently.
