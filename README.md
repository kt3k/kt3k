:wave: Hello

I'm @kt3k, Yoshiya Hinosawa. I'm a web developer in :jp: with about 10 year experience in web development. I'm currently a partner of an autonomous robot startup @seqsense.

I'm also a Deno :sauropod: enthusiast in my spare time.

I'm also interested in such topics like Domain Driven Design, Software documentation, etc.

My main languages are JavaScript and TypeScript. I've published [~100 packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~kt3k) to npm.

I've been lately learning the languages like Rust :crab:, Go, and OCaml :camel:.

I have experience in development in the languages like Python :snake:, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Java :coffee:, Objective-C, C++, Kotlin, Groovy, ActionScript, etc in the past.

I was an enthusiast of code golf :golfing: in the past and once was addicted in the golfing site [Anarchy Golf](http://golf.shinh.org/), which is still working. I created solutions in [so many languages](https://github.com/kt3k/anarchy-golf-old-solutions), but I don't remember most of them now.
